🚀 Starting Retry Publisher Example
=====================================
This publisher will send different types of messages to demonstrate:
- Successful processing
- Retry mechanism (nack → retry queue → main queue)
- Final failure after max retries

📨 Publishing 3 'success' messages (Should be processed successfully (acknowledged))...

🎯 ALL MESSAGES PUBLISHED!
=====================================
Messages have been sent to the retry-exchange.
Start the retry_consumer to see the retry mechanism in action:
  cd examples/retry_consumer && ./retry_consumer

Expected behavior:
✅ 'success' messages: Immediate acknowledgment
🔄 'retry' messages: Fail 2 times, succeed on 3rd (via retry queue)
❌ 'fail' messages: Exhaust retries, go to final DLQ

Monitor the queues:
- retry-queue: Main processing queue
- retry-queue.retry: Temporary retry queue (5s TTL)
- retry-queue.failed: Final DLQ for permanently failed messages
